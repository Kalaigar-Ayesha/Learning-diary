    <p>PU college was a whirlwind of textbooks and late nights. The pressure to perform hung heavy in the air. We were constantly bombarded with lectures, assignments, and mock tests. Every spare minute was seen as an opportunity to squeeze in some extra studying.  The library became a second home, fueled by the anxieties of entrance exams.  Despite the stress, there was a strange sense of camaraderie amongst us students, a shared understanding of the struggles we faced. We pushed each other, motivated each other, and found pockets of laughter even under the weight of expectation.</p>

    <p>The main turning point in my life came right after completing my pre-university education, where my academic focus had been primarily on biology. Little did I anticipate that a significant shift awaited me at this juncture. Upon concluding my pre-university coursework, I found myself at a crossroads, faced with the pivotal decision of choosing my field of further study. Despite my background in biology, circumstances steered me towards engineering. This transition marked a profound moment of divergence in my academic journey, propelling me into a realm of technical knowledge and problem-solving that I had not previously explored. Embracing this change demanded adaptation, determination, and a willingness to embark on an entirely new intellectual adventure. In hindsight, while the decision to pivot towards engineering was initially daunting, it ultimately led me down a path rich with discovery, growth, and unforeseen opportunities, shaping the trajectory of my life in profound ways.</p>
